        <h2 class="headline">Dad Claims He's "Not Sleeping - Just Resting His Eyes" For the Fourth Time Today</h2>
        <div class="subheadline">Local father maintains consciousness despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary</div>
        <div class="byline">By <em>The Snarky Doodler</em></div>

        <div class="article-content">
            <p><span class="location">PANCAKE, PENNSYLVANIA</span> - In a move that surprised absolutely no one, father Jay Harper, 49, made his fourth statement of the day Sunday afternoon - clarifying to his family that he was "not sleeping, just resting [his] eyes".</p>

            <p>This claim was delivered at 3:26pm. Harper was discovered slouched in his favorite recliner, mouth wide open, and the remote gripped loosely as the Philadelphia Union game played silently in the background.</p>

            <p>"I'm not asleep, just resting my eyes," Harper mumbled, barely audible over his own snoring. "Just listening to the game."</p>

            <p>Harper's wife, Linda, and daughter Jessica, report exchanging knowing glances, having heard similar claims that morning, at breakfast, after lunch, and while Harper was standing in the garage "thinking about mowing the lawn".</p>

            <p>The family confirms this is part of a longstanding tradition, dating back to at least 2010, when Harper denied napping during his daughter's kindergarten Christmas pageant. "He's been resting his eyes for over a decade now," commented wife, Linda. "At this point, I don't think he knows what real sleep feels like."</p>

            <p>Experts report the phenomenon, known as "Dad Resting Eye Syndrome", affects millions of fathers nationwide, typically affecting weekends, holidays and movies rated below PG-13.</p>

            <p>At time of report, Harper was seen "resting his eyes" in the backyard hammock while a lawnmower sat idle nearby.</p>
